# Documentation

## 1. Overview

This folder contains all methodology documentation, formal specifications, and standards for the RBH-1 validation project. These documents define how the validation is executed, how the Analysis-Ready Dataset is structured, and how documentation itself is organized.

Scientists reviewing the validation should start with the specification documents. Contributors should review documentation standards before creating new content.
