# Inference Data

## 1. Overview

This folder will contain MCMC chains, posterior samples, and derived statistical products from Phases 5-7. These outputs form the core evidence for the validation paper and materialize directly to the ARD inference layer.

**Status:** ⏳ Pending — Population begins with Phase 5 (Kinematic Fitting).

---

## 2. Contents

*None — awaiting Phase 5 implementation.*

---

## 3. Subdirectories

*None — this folder has no subdirectories.*
